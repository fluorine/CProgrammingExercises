C programming exercises
=======================
These are some of my implementations for my
programming exercises on C programming language.

My reference books are:
 - The C Programming language, 2th edition
 - Programming in C
 - Data Structures and Algorithms made easy,
   by Narasimha Karumanchi

Projects were created using Dev-C++, but
the source files (`*.c`) can be opend using
any text editor.
